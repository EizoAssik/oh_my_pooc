# EO4 - Roommate Conflict #

A1: Hi, how's it going recently?

B1: These days I always can't sleep well. Because roommates have different sleeping time. Some people is used to go bed early, but other people tend to sleep late.

A2: Oh, that a bad situation, but you had to solve it. As roommates, you need to study together, live together, and so as to help each other. But different people have different characteristics and living habits. Thus, it is inevitable to have conflicts with your roommates, I think.

B2: Yes, conflicts originate from differences. If you are a quite serious person, you need peace and privacy at the place where you live, but your roommate enjoys holding parties time and time again. You will find it impossible for you to avoid conflicts with that person.

A3: I've suffered from that three years ago, during high school. One Rock fans, one bathroom singer, one top student, and me. You can image how many problmes it could be.

B3: Living with roommates isn’t always easy. We're sharing a living space, after all. So it may be stressful, and conflicts may arise. Sometimes situations that work at the beginning of the year become more difficult as the year goes on.

A4: But you and your roommate will be constantly growing and changing in your time in the following two years. Conflicts is perfectly normal, some way. In fact, there is a great deal to be learned from handling a difficult situation maturely, respectfully, and creatively.

B4: So...no matter where we live, facing conflicts with different people is just inevitable?

A5: Almost, inevitable.

B5: And normal?

A6: Yes, normal.

B6: So have you thinked about any possible solution?

A7: I think all of your roommates do want to take measures to solve any existing problem because no one want to live in a place full of conflicts. And that's why we need to talk. If you start to notice that there may be any conflict, a roommate who got annoyed with you over any thing unusually, or anyone had bothered you, thats may be a sign of potential issues. And that's the point you should go and talk to him.

B7: Talk directly or not?

A8: Were I you, I'd talk to your roommate directly. Be direct, and clear, about what is bothering you. If you don’t tell your roommate that there is a problem they won’t be able to do anything about it. But never discuss it behind them.

B8: Will it work?

A9: Not sure.

B9: Okay, I'll try it. Thank you.
